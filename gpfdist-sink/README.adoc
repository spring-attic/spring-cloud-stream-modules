= Gpfdist Sink

A sink module that route messages into `GPDB/HAWQ` segments via
_gpfdist_ protocol.

The gpfdist sink allows you to stream data in parallel to either
_Pivotal Greenplum DB_ or _Pivotal HAWQ_. Internally, this sink
creates a custom listener that supports the gpfdist protocol and
schedules a task that orchestrates a gpload session in the same
way it is done natively in Greenplum.

No data is written into temporary files and all data is kept in
stream buffers waiting to get inserted into Greenplum DB or HAWQ.
If there are no existing load sessions from Greenplum, the sink
will block until such sessions are established.

== Options

The **$$gpfdist$$** $$sink$$ supports the following configuration properties:

$$table$$::
$$Database table to work with.$$ *($$String$$, default: ``, required)*
+
This option denotes a table where data will be inserted or updated.
Also external table structure will be derived from structure of this
table.
+
Currently `table` is only way to define a structure of an external
table. Effectively it will replace `other_table` in below clause
segment.
+
```
CREATE READABLE EXTERNAL TABLE table_name LIKE other_table
```
$$mode$$::
$$Gpfdist mode, either `insert` or `update`.$$ *($$String$$, default: `insert`)*
+
Currently only `insert` and `update` gpfdist mode is supported. Mode
`merge` familiar from a native gpfdist loader is not yet supported.
+
For mode `update` options `matchColumns` and `updateColumns` are
required.
$$columnDelimiter$$::
$$Data record column delimiter.$$ *($$Character$$, default: ``)*
+
Defines used `delimiter` character in below clause segment which would
be part of a `FORMAT 'TEXT'` or `FORMAT 'CSV'` sections.
+
```
[DELIMITER AS 'delimiter']
```
$$segmentRejectLimit$$::
$$Error reject limit.$$ *($$String$$, default: ``)*
+
Defines a `count` value in a below clause segment.
+
```
[ [LOG ERRORS INTO error_table] SEGMENT REJECT LIMIT count
  [ROWS | PERCENT] ]
```
+
As a conveniance this reject limit also recognizes a percentage format
`2%` and if used, `segmentRejectType` is automatically set to
`percent`.
$$segmentRejectType$$::
$$Error reject type, either `rows` or `percent`.$$ *($$String$$, default: ``)*
+
Defines `ROWS` or `PERCENT` in below clause segment.
+
```
[ [LOG ERRORS INTO error_table] SEGMENT REJECT LIMIT count
  [ROWS | PERCENT] ]
```
$$errorTable$$::
$$Tablename to log errors.$$ *($$String$$, default: ``)*
+
As error table is optional with `SEGMENT REJECT LIMIT`, it's only used
if both `segmentRejectLimit` and `segmentRejectType` are set. Sets
`error_table` in below clause segment.
+
```
[ [LOG ERRORS INTO error_table] SEGMENT REJECT LIMIT count
  [ROWS | PERCENT] ]
```
$$nullString$$::
$$Null string definition.$$ *($$String$$, default: ``)*
+
Defines used `null string` in below clause segment which would
be part of a `FORMAT 'TEXT'` or `FORMAT 'CSV'` sections.
+
```
[NULL AS 'null string']
```
$$delimiter$$::
$$Data record delimiter for incoming messages.$$ *($$String$$, default: `\n`)*
+
On default a delimiter in this option will be added as a postfix to
every message sent into this sink. Currently _NEWLINE_ is not a
supported config option and line termination for data is coming from a
default functionality.
+

____________________________________________________________________
If not specified, a Greenplum Database segment will detect the
newline type by looking at the first row of data it receives and
using the first newline type encountered.
____________________________________________________________________
$$matchColumns$$::
$$Comma delimited list of columns to match.$$ *($$String$$, default: ``)*
+
[NOTE]
=====
See more from examples below.
=====
$$updateColumns$$::
$$Comma delimited list of columns to update.$$ *($$String$$, default: ``)*

[NOTE]
=====
See more from examples below.
=====
$$sqlBefore$$::
$$Sql clause to run before each load operation.$$ *($$String$$, default: ``)*
$$sqlAfter$$::
$$Sql clause to run after each load operation.$$ *($$String$$, default: ``)*
$$rateInterval$$::
$$Debug rate of data transfer.$$ *($$Integer$$, default: `0`)*
+
If set to non zero, sink will log a rate of messages passing throught
a sink after number of messages denoted by this setting has been
processed. Value `0` means that this rate calculation and logging is
disabled.
$$flushCount$$::
$$Max collected size per windowed data.$$ *($$Integer$$, default: `100`)*
+
[NOTE]
=====
For more info on flush and batch settings, see above.

$$flushTime$$::
$$Release time of collected windowed data in seconds.$$ *($$Integer$$, default: `2`)*
$$batchCount$$::
$$Number of windowed batches each segment to take.$$ *($$Integer$$, default: `100`)*
$$batchTimeout$$::
$$Timeout in seconds for segment inactivity.$$ *($$Integer$$, default: `4`)*
$$batchPeriod$$::
$$Time in seconds for each load operation to sleep in between operations.$$ *($$Integer$$, default: `10`)*
$$dbName$$::
$$Database name.$$ *($$String$$, default: `gpadmin`)*
$$dbUser$$::
$$Database user.$$ *($$String$$, default: `gpadmin`)*
$$dbPassword$$::
$$Database password.$$ *($$String$$, default: `gpadmin`)*

+
Default port `0` indicates that a random port is chosen.

== How Data Is Sent Into Segments
There are few important concepts involving how data passes into a
sink, through it and finally lands into a database.

* Sink has its normal message handler for incoming data from a source
  module, gpfdist protocol listener based on netty where segments
  connect to and in between those two a reactor based streams
  controlling load balancing into different segment connections.
* Incoming data is first sent into a reactor which first constructs a
  windows. This window is then released into a downstream when it gets
  full(`flushTime`) or timeouts(`flushTime`) if window doesn't get full.
  One window is then ready to get send into a segment.
* Segments which connects to this stream are now able to see a stream
  of window data, not stream of individual messages. We can also call
  this as a stream of batches.
* When segment makes a connection to a protocol listener it subscribes
  itself into this stream and takes count of batches denoted by
  `batchCount` and completes a stream if it got enough batches or if
  `batchTimeout` occurred due to inactivity.
* It doesn't matter how many simultaneous connections there are from
  a database cluster at any given time as reactor will load balance
  batches with all subscribers.
* Database cluster will initiate this loading session when select is
  done from an external table which will point to this sink. These
  loading operations are run in a background in a loop one after
  another. Option `batchPeriod` is then used as a sleep time in
  between these load sessions.

Lets take a closer look how options `flushCount`, `flushTime`,
`batchCount`, `batchTimeout` and `batchPeriod` work.

As in a highest level where incoming data into a sink is windowed,
`flushCount` and `flushTime` controls when a batch of messages are
sent into a downstream. If there are a lot of simultaneous segment
connections, flushing less will keep more segments inactive as there
is more demand for batches than what flushing will produce.

When existing segment connection is active and it has subscribed
itself with a stream of batches, data will keep flowing until either
`batchCount` is met or `batchTimeout` occurs due to inactivity of data
from an upstream. Higher a `batchCount` is more data each segment
will read. Higher a `batchTimeout` is more time segment will wait in
case there is more data to come.

As gpfdist load operations are done in a loop, `batchPeriod` simply
controls not to run things in a buzy loop. Buzy loop would be ok if
there is a constant stream of data coming in but if incoming data is
more like bursts then buzy loop would be unnecessary.

[NOTE]
=====
Data loaded via gpfdist will not become visible in a database until
whole distributed loading session have finished successfully.
=====

Reactor is also handling backpressure meaning if existing load
operations will not produce enought demand for data, eventually
message passing into a sink will block. This happens when Reactor's
internal ring buffer(size of 32 items) gets full. Flow of data through
sink really happens when data is pulled from it by segments.

== Example Usage

In this first example we're just creating a simple stream which
inserts data from a `time` source. Let's create a table with two
_text_ columns.
```
gpadmin=# create table ticktock (date text, time text);
```

Create a simple stream `gpstream`.
```
dataflow:>stream create --name gpstream1 --definition "time | gpfdist
--dbHost=mdw --table=ticktock --batchTime=1 --batchPeriod=1
--flushCount=2 --flushTime=2 --columnDelimiter=' '" --deploy
```

Let it run and see results from a database.
```
gpadmin=# select count(*) from ticktock;
 count
-------
    14
(1 row)
```

In previous example we did a simple inserts into a table. Let’s see
how we can update data in a table. Create a simple table _httpdata_ with
three text columns and insert some data.
```
gpadmin=# create table httpdata (col1 text, col2 text, col3 text);
gpadmin=# insert into httpdata values ('DATA1', 'DATA', 'DATA');
gpadmin=# insert into httpdata values ('DATA2', 'DATA', 'DATA');
gpadmin=# insert into httpdata values ('DATA3', 'DATA', 'DATA');
```

Now table looks like this.
```
gpadmin=# select * from httpdata;
 col1  | col2 | col3 
-------+------+------
 DATA3 | DATA | DATA
 DATA2 | DATA | DATA
 DATA1 | DATA | DATA
(3 rows)
```

Let’s create a stream which will update table _httpdata_ by matching a
column _col1_ and updates columns _col2_ and _col3_.
```
dataflow:>stream create --name gpfdiststream2 --definition "http
--server.port=8081|gpfdist --mode=update --table=httpdata
--dbHost=mdw --columnDelimiter=',' --matchColumns=col1
--updateColumns=col2,col3" --deploy
```

Post some data into a stream which will be passed into a _gpfdist_ sink
via _http_ source.
```
curl --data "DATA1,DATA1,DATA1" -H "Content-Type:text/plain" http://localhost:8081/
```

If you query table again, you’ll see that row for _DATA1_ has been
updated.
```
gpadmin=# select * from httpdata;
 col1  | col2  | col3  
-------+-------+-------
 DATA3 | DATA  | DATA
 DATA2 | DATA  | DATA
 DATA1 | DATA1 | DATA1
(3 rows)
```


== Tuning Transfer Rate
Default values for options `flushCount`, `flushTime`, `batchCount`,
`batchTimeout` and `batchPeriod` are relatively conservative and needs
to be _tuned_ for every use case for optimal performance. Order to make
a decision on how to tune sink behaviour to suit your needs few things
needs to be considered.

* What is an average size of messages ingested by a sink.
* How fast you want data to become visible in a database.
* Is incoming data a constant flow or a bursts of data.

Everything what flows throught a sink is kept in-memory and because
sink is handling backpressure, memory consumption is relatively low.
However because sink cannot predict what is an average size of
an incoming data and this data is anyway windowed later in a
downstream you should not allow window size to become too large if
average data size is large as every batch of data is kept in memory.

Generally speaking if you have a lot of segments in a load operation,
it's adviced to keep flushed window size relatively small which allows
more segments to stay active. This however also depends on how much
data is flowing in into a sink itself.

Longer a load session for each segment is active higher the overall
transfer rate is going to be. Option `batchCount` naturally controls
this. However option `batchTimeout` then really controls how fast each
segment will complete a stream due to inactivity from upstream and to
step away from a loading session to allow distributes session to
finish and data become visible in a database.
