{% capture billboard_description %}

Spring Cloud Stream Applications are [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) based [Spring Integration](http://projects.spring.io/spring-integration/) applications that provide integration with external systems. 
Spring Cloud Stream Applications can be used with [Spring Cloud Stream](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream) to create, 
build, and operationalize message-driven data microservices.

{% endcapture %}

{% capture main_content %}

Spring Cloud Stream Applications are standalone executable applications that communicate over messaging middleware such as Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ. These applications can run independently on variety of runtime platforms including: Cloud Foundry, Apache Yarn, Apache Mesos, Kubernetes, Docker, or even on your laptop.

## Features

* Run standalone as Spring applications
* Create streaming pipelines with data microservice applications
* Host and consume data microservice applications as maven dependencies
* Override configuration parameters via command-line, environment variables, or YAML file
* Provide infrastructure to test the applications in isolation

## Quick Start

Step 1 - Clone [Spring Cloud Stream Applications](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters.git) repository

Step 2 - [Build and Install Apps](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters#spring-cloud-stream-app-starters)

Step 3 - Start Kafka

Step 4 - Run **Time Source** and Bind to *ticktock* Queue
```
java -jar apps/time-source-kafka/target/time-source-kafka-***.jar --spring.cloud.stream.bindings.output.destination=ticktock
```

Step 5 - Run **Log Sink** and Bind to *ticktock* Queue
```
java -jar apps/log-sink-kafka/target/log-sink-kafka-***.jar --spring.cloud.stream.bindings.input.destination=ticktock
```

Step 6 - Verify *ticktock* Logs in Console
