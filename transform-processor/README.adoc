= Transform Processor
Use the transform app in a stream to convert a Message's content or structure.

The transform processor is used by passing a SpEL expression. The expression should return the modified message or payload. For example, `--expression=payload.toUpperCase()`.

This transform will convert all message payloads to upper case.

As part of the SpEL expression you can make use of the pre-registered JSON Path function. The syntax is #jsonPath(payload,'<json path expression>')

== Options

The **$$transform$$** $$processor$$ has the following options:

$$expression$$:: $$a SpEL expression used to transform messages$$ *($$String$$, default: `payload.toString()`)*
