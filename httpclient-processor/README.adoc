= Http Client Processor

A processor app that makes requests to an HTTP resource and emits the response body as a message payload. This processor can be combined, e.g., with a time source app to periodically poll results from a HTTP resource.

== Options

The **$$httpclient$$** $$processor$$ has the following options:

$$url$$:: The URL to issue an http request to, as a static value.
$$urlExpression$$:: A SpEL expression against incoming message to determine the URL to use.
$$httpMethod$$:: The kind of http method to use.
$$body$$:: The (static) body of the request to use.
$$bodyExpression$$:: A SpEL expression against incoming message to derive the request body to use.
$$headersExpression$$:: A SpEL expression used to derive the http headers map to use.
$$expectedResponseType$$:: The type used to interpret the response.
$$replyExpression$$:: A SpEL expression used to compute the final result, applied against the whole http response.
