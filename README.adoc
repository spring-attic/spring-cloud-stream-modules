= PLEASE NOTE: This project is no longer actively developed.

The contents of this repository have been moved over to https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters.  

This repository produced maven artifacts using Redis as the transport.  The app-starters repository produces Maven and Docker artifacts that use RabbitMQ and Kafka as the transport.  

The use of Redis as a transport is not recommended in production.  If you still want to use Redis, you may modify the transport dependency used in the app-starters build files.  The easiest way to do this is to create a new application using the Spring Initialzr web application for Spring Cloud Stream located at https://start-scs.cfapps.io/ and edit the pom.xml or build.gradle file.

Please refer to the app-starters repository for more information.
